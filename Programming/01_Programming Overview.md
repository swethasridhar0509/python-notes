# Programming Overview

## Programming

1. **Programming** involves creating instructions that a computer can execute to perform specific tasks.
2. **Purpose/Problem Solved** 
    - **Solves Computational Problems**: Programming is used to find solutions to complex mathematical and logical problems.
    - **Automates Repetitive Tasks**: It allows for the automation of tasks that would be tedious or time-consuming if done manually.
    - **Enables Application Development**: Programming is essential for creating software applications that address real-world issues.
3. The basic structure of a program includes: Input, Processing, and Output.
4. **Key programming paradigms:** Object-Oriented, Functional, Procedural.

## **Problem-Solving Steps**

### 1. Understanding the Problem

- Identify the problem and define the tasks clearly.
- Identify the inputs and expected outputs
- Break the problem into sub-problems or components.

### 2. Algorithm design

- Create a step-by-step plan to solve the problem.
- Use flowcharts or pseudocode to visualize the flow of logic.

### 3. Coding

- Translate the algorithm into a programming language.
- Ensure to follow syntax rules and conventions.

### 4. Compilation/Interpretation

- Process the source code to machine code (Binary format) using a compiler/interpreter.
- The difference between a compiler and an interpreter: A compiler translates the entire code at once, while an interpreter translates code line-by-line.
- **Why?** The computer understands only binary code.
- Check for syntax errors during this step.

### 5. Execution

- The CPU handles the execution part.
- **Memory (RAM)**: Stores instructions and data.
- The OS loads the program into **RAM,** manages resources, and schedules execution.

### 6. Testing

- Test the program for correctness using sample inputs.
- Debug any issues that arise.

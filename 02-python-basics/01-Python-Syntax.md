## **White space and Indentation**

- Python uses **whitespace and indentation** to define code blocks instead of braces `{}` or keywords.
- Incorrect indentation will raise an **IndentationError**.
- A Python statement ends with a newline character.
- Statements can be continued to the next line using a backslash (`\`) or enclosing them in parentheses.

## **Comments**

- Comments are used to document code and ignored by the Interpreter.
- Comments - block, inline, and documentation string.
- Create a block and Inline comment using ‘#’.
- Inline comments -  placed on the same line as a statement.

## **Docstrings**

- String literal to explain a function.
- Accessed using `obj.__doc__`
- Created using Triple quotes.

## **Keywords**

- Reserved words with special meanings in Python.
- Use the keyword module to list the current keywords.
- Cannot be used as identifiers, throws syntax errors.

## **Statements, Expressions, and Functions**

- **Statement**  - a complete line of code that performs an action.
- **Expressions** - combinations of values, variables, and operators that evaluates to something.
- **Functions** - reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
